TODO:

- use factorio localised_name for recipes and products
- checkbox for "only current available recipes"
- read inserter/machines/chests from cheat command and include in dump (would make many advanced settings obsolete or more convenient to use)
- limit inserter (instead of outserter) or make it a setting
