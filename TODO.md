TODO:

- drag & drop recipes_dump.txt file (no open & copy & paste)
- replace table with separate filters into one filterable table (first find one suitable to filter by column and (de)select single rows)
- make ingame command copy button
- hide advanced settings into collapsible area
- use factorio localised_name for recipes and products
- checkbox for "only current available recipes"
- hide json output in collapsible debug area
- make output bp string copy button
- not use ------- as delimiter

- read inserter/machines/chests from cheat command and include in dump (would make many advanced settings obsolete)
