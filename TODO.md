TODO:

- use factorio localised_name for recipes and products
- checkbox for "only current available recipes"
- hide uncraftable recipes somehow (e.g. plane)
- not use ------- as delimiter
- read inserter/machines/chests from cheat command and include in dump (would make many advanced settings obsolete)
